# Project Macaroni
__Marketing Campaign Return Optimisation and Improvement__


# Project Background
## Project Overview, Definition
A previous campaign was conducted 6 months ago, where the marketing team targeted a random selection of your mortgage customer base. These customers were offered this home insurance
product but only a small number of them took it out.
The campaign results are available, and we also have access to other data we already hold on customers

## Problem Statement
The marketing department has asked to use the previous campaign data to improve the selection of candidate customersm so a higher proportion will purchase the product in a future marketing campaign.

The expected solution is a binary classification machine learning model.
This model can be used in as a batch inferencing service to predict how likely existing customers are going to take out a home insurance
It is also an opportunity to continuously predict if a new mortgage costumer is likely to take a home insurance out or not.

The model's performance will be measured with the Precision. This metric is the proportion of True Positives within all predicted positives.

By not looking at False Negatives we are leaving customers out of the campaign who would purchase.
In the future we can improve on this project by optimising the models along other metrics, i.e.: F1-score.
